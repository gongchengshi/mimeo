Warn the user each time they are navigating away from a Mimeo site.
Probably need to use MimeoGraph to transform the external URLs in the served content.
http://not-mimeo/ -> http://mimeo/?url=http://www.example.com/path/file.html?param=value
http://mimeo/job1/site1/ -> http://mimeo/?url=http://www.example.com/path/file.html?param=value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simplify ResolveAddress in MimeoProxy by collapsing duplicate code in a way that maintains clarity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix issue with Mimeo when there are more ../ than there are directories in the path (go to root)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have Mimeo's 404 be a list of other possible places to look for the same URL but different version/crawl time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Display Mimeo page in frame - show the time the page was crawled at the top and a link to the original page. This shows that the user is still within the bounds of the crawled site and hasn't accidently moved to the live site.
